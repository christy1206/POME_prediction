# POME_prediction

Six different models derived from machine learning were developed in describing the response of POME degradation (%) with respects to all three main factors (O2 flowrate, TiO2 loadings and Initial concentration of POME) and interactions among them. 

The 6 models are:
1) Gaussian process regression (GPR)
2) Linear regression (LR)
3) Decision tree (DT)
4) Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5) Regression Tree Ensemble (RTE)
6) Quadratic curve fitting

Software is written and tested using Matlab 2020a, toolbox required:

1) Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

Contour plots and the 3D surface response plots between O2 flow rate and TiO2 loading at 250ppm POME initial concentration for the baseline and GPR methods:
